# About Learn
I have created this GitHub repository to store my tests and exercises for practicing what I have learned about programming and machine learning. I have also made notes to explain my code and thinking because I enjoy storytelling. 

If you decide to look into my code, be prepared for syntax confetti and basic mistakes. After all, Python is like learning a new language in which the journey starts with piecing together words which maybe grammatically incorrect. I hope you find my repository to be entertaining. 

I invite you to comment and connect with me.
